<span data-ttu-id="0ab1b-p111">Excel 2007 で導入された、マルチ スレッド再計算 (MTR) を使用すると、スレッド セーフな XLL ワークシート関数を作成できます。マルチ スレッド サーバーにアクセスするのに、これらの関数を使用できます。以下のセクションでは、ユーザーが観察するパフォーマンスをどのように大幅に向上させることができるかを詳細に説明します。処理能力を大量に消費する必要がある Excel ユーザーに対して、MTR を使用する XLL と強力な計算サーバーの組み合わせは、最高のパフォーマンス ソリューションを提供します。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="0ab1b-p111">Multithreaded recalculation (MTR), which was introduced in Excel 2007, enables you to create thread-safe XLL worksheet functions. You can use these functions to access multithreaded servers. Later sections describe more fully how this can dramatically increase the performance observed by the user. For Excel users who sometimes need access to a lot of processing power, the combination of an XLL that uses MTR and a powerful calculation server provides the highest-performance solution.</span></span>

DLL and XLL functions and commands that are called by VBA when VBA has itself been called by Excel can call the C API. You cannot, for example, set a timed Windows callback into your XLL and call the C API from it, and you cannot call the C API from a background thread created by your XLL.

DLLs cannot call XLM flow control functions from within the C API. These macro-sheet functions and commands are documented in the Help file XLMacr8.hlp (formerly named Macrofun.hlp).

Consequently, much of the new functionality introduced in later versions of Excel is available through VBA, but not through XLM or the C API. For example, several commands, event traps, and enhanced dialog box capabilities are available through VBA, but not through XLM or the C API.</span></span>
