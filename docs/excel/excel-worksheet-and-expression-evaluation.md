For example, if the cell B2 contains the formula  `=A1`, copying this to cell B1 results in a formula **=#REF!**. This error is also generated in formulas that contain a reference that is overwritten in a cut-and-paste operation or is deleted in a row, column, or worksheet deletion. Some functions that can return references can return this error, for example,  `OFFSET(A1,-1,-1)`. Worksheet names whose definitions contain references that become invalid are evaluated to this error.</span></span>
